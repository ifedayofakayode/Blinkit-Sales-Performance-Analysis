# Blinkit-Sales-Performance-Analysis
This project delivers a comprehensive data analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, I derive insights through key performance indicators (KPIs) and various visualizations. The goal is to identify trends and areas for operational and strategic improvement.
